# CAISOAPI PROGRAM

Internship project, creating a program to pull various price reports from the CAISO OASIS API (oasis.caiso.com). The purpose of the program is for simplified and more efficient data pulling for consultants and analysts at Energy Strategies.

Installation
- Download gui.exe to your local machine, and click to open.
- Find dist folder and navigate to gui.exe
- The GUI/Program will open, and you can input your desired report variables.
- The excel file with the report will automatically generate in your chosen file destination once finished.

Notes for use:
- Separate multiple nodes with a comma.
- All times are set in GMT.
- Each requested report will include the actual report, and the hourly averages. (DAM will be the same, as it is already an hourly report).

Files in GitHub:
- For GUI: use gui.py, or gui.exe if python libraries and extensions are not installed
- Backend(API) code: backend.py
- Detailed documentation: documentation.txt (includes daily log and processes)
- Data dictionary: Notes about each report type under the 'prices' tab at the CASIO OASIS site. 
- All other files are part of the creation process, including learning and testing new python skills.
