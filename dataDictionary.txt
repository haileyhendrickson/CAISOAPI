FOR QUERYING:
url = 'http://oasis.caiso.com/oasisapi/SingleZip' ALWAYS THIS
startdate = yyyymmdd format, no dashes
starttime = hr:mn (00:00)
enddate = yyyymmdd format, no dashes
endtime = hr:mn (00:00)
queryname = specifies the kind of report wanted. EX: 'PRC_LMP' for hourly locational marginal prices
marketRunID = specifies the type of market (DAM or RTM, HASP), RTPD

QUERY NAME OPTIONS:
- PRC_LMP : Locational Marginal Prices (works, mostly)
    DAM, 60 mins, 
- PRC_SPTIE_LMP : Interval, FMM, Scheduling Point/Tie Combination Locational Marginal Prices (doesn't print all of the files, just some)
    DAM, 60 mins, 
- PRC_INTVL_LMP : Interval Locational Marginal Prices (works great! just slow)
    RTM, 5 mins,
- PRC_HASP_LMP : HASP Locational Marginal Prices (works great, just slow)
    HASP (hour ahead), 15 mins, 
- PRC_RTPD_LMP : FMM Locational Marginal Prices (works, just slow)
    RTPD (real time pre-dispatch), 15 mins
- PRC_DS_REF : Reference Prices (prints the first file, can't figure it out after that. watch nodes)
    N/A market, quarterly
- PRC_CD_INTVL_LMP : Contingency Dispatch Locational Marginal Prices (only printed a few lines, but it breaks after 1 file)
    RTM, 10 mins
- PRC_CD_SPTIE_LMP: Contingency Dispatch Scheduling Point/Tie Combination Locational Marginal Prices (haven't figured out, requres specific nodes and dates I think)
    RTM, 10 mins
- PRC_RTM_LAP : Hourly RTM LAP Prices (couldn't get it to work. probably specific node types or something)
    RTM, 60
-- Group ones: Hourly Energy Price Shaping Factor (not including unless requested)

CSV: Depends on the Query Name
PRC_INTVL_LMP
- 'NODE_ID_XML': node ID
- 'NODE_ID': node ID
- 'NODE': node ID
- 'LMP_TYPE': MCC= Congestion, MCE= Energy, MCL= Loss, LMP= LMP IDK?
- 'PNODE_RESMRID':  node ID
- 'GRP_TYPE': group type. OPTIONS? I think this has to do with the nodes. (ap vs all nodes). grp_type=ALL_APNODES to request my data which returned only the APNodes. Instead I used grp_type=ALL which returns the nodes that can be found on their price map as well as the APNode
- 'POS'

Codes containing 'REN' (renewables)
- 'RENEWABLE_TYPE': type of renewable, ex: solar, wind
- 'TRADING_HUB':
- 'LABEL': Like the title of the data pull? 
- 'MARKET_RUN_ID_POS': code for market run ID?
- 'RENEW_POS': code for renewable type?

ALL CODES 
- 'INTERVALSTARTTIME_GMT': interval start  in GMT - happens in 5 minute intervals for this query type
- 'INTERVALENDTIME_GMT': interval end time in GMT
- 'OPR_DT': operation date
- 'OPR_HR':
- 'XML_DATA_ITEM': includes LMP type, and part of query name
- 'MARKET_RUN_ID': type of market (inputted by user) (DAM, RUC, etc)
- 'GROUP'
- 'MW': megawats? This could be the price?
- 'OPR_INTERVAL': a numerical code for what time interval it is (1 for 0:00, 2 for 15:00, etc)
